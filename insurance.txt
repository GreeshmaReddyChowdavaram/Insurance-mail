To all ACIS Employees in Capgemini India

Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to inform you about the opportunity to cover your parents and/or parents-in-law under the Voluntary Parents Medical Policy of Capgemini. As a part of the policy, your parents and/or parents-in-law are eligible for medical insurance coverage wherein, up to 4 dependent members can be covered (cross selection of the parents is permissible).

This policy is a comprehensive program, which has been specifically customized for Capgemini India employees and offers significant value over regular retail programs available in the market. It is optional, and the premium would have to be borne by the employee.

Please note that we are in process of realigning the renewal dates across Capgemini entities to 01st Feb. As per this initiative 2018-19 policy will be renewed for 11 months which is upto 31st Jan 2019 and premium will be collected on pro-rata basis.

You will be provided one more opportunity in month of January 2019 to enrolment parents for next policy cycle.

Some of the salient features of the policy are:

Cashless facility for hospitalization at network hospitals
Co-pay of 20% on each claim
One-year waiting period for specified illness has been waived off
Undergoing medical tests is not required for enrolment
The premium paid for parents only (not parents-in-law) would be eligible for tax benefits under section 80D of the Income Tax Act. (You are not required to submit details of deduction separately for Tax benefits. The payroll team will take note of it since the deduction is made directly from your salary)
Coverage

The policy coverage is effective from February 1, 2018 (or DOJ) to January 31, 2019.
Only persons up to the age of 80 years can be covered under the policy
